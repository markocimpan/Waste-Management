## Changes Made UX/UI Enhancements

1. Filter by Size -> Added a dropdown menu to filter skips by yard size. Only displays skips with a yard value greater than the selected option.
2. Sort Skips -> Added a second dropdown to sort skips by price or size.
3. Skip Information Badges -> Each skip now displays a badge showing the yard size or if a skip is not allowed on the road, a red "Danger" badge is shown.
4. Skip Card Design Improvements -> Reduced the size of the skip cards so more can be seen on the screen at once. Updated the visual design of the selected/unselected state.Improved the layout and style of the price and selection indicators for better user experience.
